    <h1>Why study difficult intubation?</h1>
    <p>
      Difficult and failed tracheal intubation are associated with hypoxia,
      hemodynamic instability, and peri‑operative morbidity. Multiple bedside
      scores (Mallampati, thyromental distance, STOP‑BANG, Al‑Ganzouri, etc.)
      have been proposed to anticipate a challenging airway, with heterogeneous
      performance across settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      intuB is a prototype web application that allows clinicians to log
      intubation episodes in a structured way and to explore how simple models
      perform on their own data. It is intended for education and quality
      improvement projects, not for real‑time triage.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      This tool does not replace clinical judgement, guidelines, or local
      airway management protocols.
